# Portfolio-Data-Science
This is my portfolio for my data-science material. Always adding onto it.
The point of this portfolio is to provide colleagues, employers, and friends, what i exactly do with the skills i've learned in data analytics/science.
I welcome feedback, and greatly appreciately tips and tricks to help with my portfolio.

As time passes, i hope to upload more content which is easy to understand and follow, but rigorous and complex as i dive deeper into data analytics/science.
